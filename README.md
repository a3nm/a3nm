### Hi there

For more information about me, see my [webpage](https://a3nm.net/).

Github is a proprietary platform owned by Microsoft, so I use it for projects that are hosted there, but I prefer to use open-source solutions: [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/) which is powered by open-source software, or various self-hosted gitlab instances. I also host my smaller projects [here](https://a3nm.net/git/) using [stagit](https://git.2f30.org/stagit/), see [here](https://a3nm.net/blog/cgit_stagit.html).
